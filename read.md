# Home Automation Repo

This is where I'll store any code developed for my home automation.
I'll also keep diagrams and documentation of my setup so that I can refer back to it.

# Outline
Using Home Assistant as a hub.
Trying to keep things off the internet if I can.
currently have a few devices like the Google mini and Nest thermostat.
I've also built a kegerator thermostat using a SonOff and tasmota.

I have a lot of ESP8266 boards as well as a few Lora boards along with a myriad of current sensors and temperature probes.

# Future Ideas

## Car plug.
I'm currently testing out some Lora devices that I plan to use for a car warmer.  First I need to validate the devices work and the range I can get.

- use Lora and a power relay to control a batter warmer and silicone oil pan heater.
- use a lora device in the house to talk to the car warmer.
  - should have a button to turn on/off power
  - two leds to tell me if the car warmer is on or off.
  - hook up to home assistant so I can see whats happening and control the warmer from there as well.
